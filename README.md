<h2 align='center'>YaHello ðŸ‘‹</h2>



I am a first-year CS student. Liked to do coding as a hobby. Currently trying to learn Machine Learning and Data analysis. 

Most things I do are in Python because it is the easiest of them all. Not really worrying about the execution time of them too much. Plus Python has a pretty good standard library and documentations for a person like me. Currently I do not have any professional expierence in anything related to CS. But I plan to do an internship in my Second year.

I do know some other languages, some of which I do use often but python can cover for them.
