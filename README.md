<h2 align='center'>YaHello ðŸ‘‹</h2>



I am a second-year CS student. Liked to do coding as a hobby. Currently trying to learn Machine Learning and Data analysis. 

Most things I do are in Python/C. Currently I do not have any professional expierence in anything related to CS. But I plan to do an internship this college year.

I do know some other languages, some of which I do use often but python can cover for them. I hate Front-End cause I am not good at it lol, I suck at HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
